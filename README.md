## Overview

The Floor Plan Colorizer is a Python script that takes a floor plan as input and colorizes the rooms within it. It reads a text-based floor plan, identifies individual rooms, and assigns random colors to them. The colorized floor plan can be saved as an image, and the room information is also saved to a text file.

## Features

- Load a floor plan from a text file.
- Identify rooms within the floor plan.
- Assign random colors to each room.
- Generate colorized floor plan images.
- Save room information to a text file.
- Display the colorized floor plan with room statistics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the Floor Plan Colorizer, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (>=3.9)

### Installation

To set up the project, you can create a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using the following commands:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
 python -m venv venv

 # Activate the virtual environment (optional but recommended)
 source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

 # Install project dependencies
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To use the Floor Plan Colorizer, follow these steps:

1. Place your floor plan text file in the `input/` directory.

2. Run the script, specifying the path to your floor plan file as a command-line argument:

   ```bash
   python floor_plan_colorizer.py input/sample_floor_plan.txt
   ```

   Replace sample_floor_plan.txt with the name of your floor plan file.

### Output

After running the Floor Plan Colorizer, you will find the following generated output:

- **Colorized Floor Plan Image**: The colorized floor plan image is saved as `<input_file_name>_output.png` in the `output/` directory.

- **Room Information**: The details of the colorized rooms are saved as `<input_file_name>_output.txt` in the `output/` directory.

- **Display**: The colorized floor plan with room statistics is displayed on the screen. And image is saved as `<input_file_name>_input_output.png` in the `output/` directory.

You can view and use these outputs for visualizing and analyzing the colorized floor plan.

### Pytest

To run tests for the Floor Plan Colorizer project, follow these steps:

1. Run the tests using pytest command:

   ```bash
   pytest -rP  --cov=. --cov-report=html --html=htmlcov/report.html
   ```

   This command will discover and execute the tests in the project. After running the tests, pytest will generate a test report and code coverage

### Test Report and Coverage

After running the tests with pytest, you can view the detailed test report by opening the HTML file generated by pytest.

1. Locate the HTML test report file, usually named `report.html` under `htmlcov/`.

2. Open the test report in your web browser to review the test results and details.
